				<h3>General Rules</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Your Torrent-Invite (T-I) username must be completely different to all of your tracker usernames. Do not use a nickname that is even remotely similar (e.g. JohnDoe --> JohnDo123). A name change may be done here or submit a report using Contact Us.</li>
					<li>Do not use an email to receive invites that contains your T-I username. e.g. JohnDoe@gmail.com when your username at Torrent-Invites.com is JohnDoe</li>
					<li>No selling or trading of invites is allowed. This includes trading on other websites. Invites must be given freely with nothing demanded in return. Anyone caught trading will be banned.</li>
					<li>Do not post your email ANYWHERE on the forum.</li>
					<li>Do not give away or request for accounts (only invites).</li>
					<li>Do not ask for an invite for yourself and then forward it to someone else.</li>
					<li>Do not ask people for invites via PM without their permission.</li>
					<li>Do not ask for or demand reputation or thanks anywhere for anything whatsoever (This includes signatures).</li>
					<li>Do not create duplicate T-I accounts</li>
					<li>If you request an invite to a tracker that you've previously been banned, deleted, or disabled at, you must disclose that information with a potential inviter BEFORE you accept the invite.</li>
					<li>Wait 24 hours before bumping a thread.</li>
					<li>Do not ask for or offer invites in the Intro section.</li>
					<li>Do not use a proxy server!</li>
					<li>Do not lie about your location (country).</li>
					<li>Do not reveal your email address publicly (only via PM).</li>
					<li>Do not tell tracker staff that you received an invite from T-I</li>
					<li>Do not tell tracker staff about what is happening at T-I.</li>
					<li>Do not advertise another invite site in any posts, replies, topics, signatures, PM's or emails.</li>
					<li>No flaming other members.</li>
					<li>Use your rep power responsibly.</li>
					<li>Signatures may not be longer than 5 single spaced lines (10 lines for VIPs and Exalted members).</li>
					<li>Do not hijack other peoples threads.</li>
					<li>Do not fight with Staff or tell them what to do.</li>
					<li>Do not argue with an infraction. Accept it and learn from it. Infractions are meant to teach, not punish.</li>
					<li>Do not spam! All posts must be meaningful and add to the conversation.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Chopping Block Rules</h3>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>Never post a user's identifying information (email, ip address, or tracker username). Doing so can result in you being permanently banned. If necessary, a staff member will ask for that information to be sent via PM.</li>
					<li>Only reply to a post if you have something important to contribute such as additional evidence. Do NOT reply if you merely wish to express an opinion. This applies to EVERYONE, including the original poster.</li>
					<li>Only traders, scammers, ratio cheaters, and SERIOUS cases of flaming should be posted on the block. All other issues, including spam, should be reported to a staff via the "Report This Thread" link in the bottom left corner of every post. Do not post members here because you think they are a collector. Collecting is frowned upon but is not against our rules. If you gave a member an invite, and they did not ever use the account, feel free to leave them a negative iGiver if you wish.</li>
					<li>If you are accused on the Chopping Block you may NOT participate in any giveaways (including your own) until your situation is resolved. Your user class will be changed to "Restricted" and you will be unable to view or post in Area 51. Additionally, any posts you make while "Restricted" will be invisible to you until a moderator approves them. Please do not post multiple times or ask what happened to your post. Rest assured that the staff can see your post and will respond accordingly.</li>
					<li>You have 48 hours to respond to the thread, unless otherwise stated. Failure to respond in the given time frame will result in your account being banned. If this happens, and you feel you can explain your situation, you may come to #TIHelp in the IRC, and ask to speak to a member of the senior staff.</li>
					<li>If you break the rules of this section, you might get an infraction (or worse) so be careful!</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Invite Section Rules</h3>
				<p id="pe">Warning:</p> If you request an invite to a tracker that you've previously had problems (disabled, banned, etc) with, you must disclose that information within your application or private message the potential inviter explaining the extenuating circumstances. Do NOT provide your email or allow the inviter to create an invite code until he's fully aware of the situation. Failure to comply may lead to your permanent ban.
				<h4>There is to be no:</h4>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square">
					<li>Trading! We do not allow trading ANYWHERE on this forum! We also do not allow our members to trade elsewhere.</li>
					<li>Ratio Cheating! Cheating on a tracker equals a permanent ban here. Don't bother telling us it was your friend, brother, sister, mother - your account, your problem.</li>
					<li>Good luck posts</li>
					<li>Great G/A posts - use the thanks button!</li>
					<li>Posting to "vouch" for someone. If the giver wants people to vouch for applicants, he will ask for it.</li>
					<li>Begging for updates on your application. If the giver chooses you, he will let you know!</li>.
					<li>Asking to be allowed to apply if you don't meet the rules set forth by the giver</li>
					<li>Complaining that you weren't chosen for an invite. If a mod sees this you will be banned!</li>
					<li>Unhelpful posts that do not relate directly to a user getting an invite or obtaining an invite.</li>
					<li>Demanding of rep or thanks as a prerequisite for receiving an invite</li>
					<li>Asking for rep or thanks in your giveaway in any way, shape, or form (including posts, signatures, and avatars)</li>
					<li>Posting offers for invites not in your possession. This includes giving away invites that do not belong to you. You may not give away your friend's invite in exchange for iGiver. Invites must come from your account and no one else's. If your friend has an invite to give away, he may sign up here himself.</li>
					<li>Asking for invites for a friend. If your friend wants a tracker, he may sign up here himself.</li>
					<li>Posting of "Secret Giveaway" or "mystery tracker" invites. Full transparency is required. If you have a genuine security concern, speak to a mod about obtaining permission first.</li>
					<li>Asking for an invite to a tracker your country is banned from. If your country is banned from a particular tracker, do NOT request an invite planning to use a proxy or some other anonymizing service to conceal your IP. You will be risking the inviter's account, so don't do it!</li>
					<li>Leaving iGivers for the same tracker to two different people. If you apply in more than one giveaway, and two people send you an invite, accept one and reject the other. ONLY leave iGiver for the person whose invite you accepted. Otherwise you may end up on the chopping block!</li>
